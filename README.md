# Contact Form with JavaScript Validation

## Project Overview
This project is a **simple contact form** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It validates user inputs **on the client side** before submission, ensuring:
- Name is not empty
- Email is in a valid format (checked with regex)
- Message is not empty

No data is sent to a server — a success message is displayed if all fields are valid.
